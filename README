Simple folder renamer from Euro (d.d.yyyy) to universal (yyyy-mm-dd) format.

I created this piece of code because Sony PlayMemories Home insists on using 
locale default date format when creating folders.

To use:
Simpy run it in a directory. It tried to find matching names and then renames them.
Alternatively, you can give a list of directories as  a parameter, to traverse all of them.
